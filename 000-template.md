# Title Here

## Summary

One to three paragraphs explaining the overall goal of this RFC. Do you want
to stop a particular class of security threat? Add a new feature?

Succinctly explain the problem and solution.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

## Assumptions

What assumptions do we make about about the elements this RFC touches?

If this is an feature with significant mimory overhead, do we assume end users
can all meet it?

If this RFC is to make a security improvement, what threat model is it
operating under? List any assumptions we make about the capabilities we feel
we can reasonably make about potential adversaries.

## Requirements

What exactly is the outcome we want, and want to enforce moving forward?

List some MUST, MUST NOT, and SHOULD statements here that people will be
expected to use as a quick reference to consider when doing engineering work.

## Design

This should be a simple bulleted explanation of the core process or outcome
that we expect when this RFC is implemented.

This could be a developer workflow, an automation workflow, a specific sequence
of events, etc.

Include any diagrams as appropriate, favoring text-based sources others can
easily edit like mermaid, UML, etc where possible, with external files sharing
the same filename prifix as this document.

## Drawbacks

Provide a few bullets honestly detailing downsides of implementing this.

Will it slow down development? Cost more resources? etc.

## Alternatives

List any alternatives others have tried, including the current solution if
there is one, to help others quickily catch up on how we got here.

## Scope

List a few items that are clearly in scope, anything that we want to do that is
explicitly deferred to future work.

## Questions

What open questions still exist that we can't answer right now?

## References

List any useful external references that might be helpful background.
